# Examples how to run the SB program:


[GaAs-Gr](GaAs-Gr) - example for GaAs-Graphene system

[Example2](Example2) - the same system but without including complex band structure (CBS) effects 



# How to prepare for the calculation:

1. Calculate DOS of the bulk
2. Calculate PDOS with k-point separated of the interface. The interface is the contact of few layers of metal with few layers of the semiconductor H-terminated on the surface exposed to vacuum.
3.
