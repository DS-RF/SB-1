# Features of SB program

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/Dmitry-Skachkov/SB/blob/main/Docs/SB_features.jpg)

1 - semiinfinite semiconductor in contact with metal surface or another semiconductor

2 - charged surface of the semiconductor 

3 - finite semiconductor with gate electrode

## SB program can calculate:

 * Schottky barrier height
 * Depletion layer width
 * Inversion layer width
 * Doping concentration
 * Charge neutrality level for interface vs VBM
 * Fermi level for intrinsic semiconductor
 * Energy filling level on the surface
 * Charge on the interface accumulated due to charge redistribution
 * Electric field close to the surface of semiconductor
 * Polarization close to the surface of semiconductor
