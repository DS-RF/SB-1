# Features of SB program

## SB program can calculate:
 * Schottky barrier height
 * Depletion layer width
 * Inversion layer width
 * Doping concentration
 * Charge neutrality level for interface vs VBM
 * Fermi level for intrinsic semiconductor
 * Energy filling level on the surface
 * Charge on the interface accumulated due to charge redistribution
 * Electric field close to the surface of semiconductor
 * Polarization close to the surface of semiconductor
 * charge distribution due to metal induced gap states (MIGS)
 * electrostatic potential (Schottky potential) and electric field due to charge redistribution

### 1 - semiinfinite semiconductor in contact with metal surface or another semiconductor

### 2 - semiconductor with charged surface in contact with metal surface or another semiconductor<sup>*</sup>

### 3 - finite length semiconductor with gate electrode in contact with metal surface or another semiconductor

### 4 - finite length semiconductor with charged surface in contact with metal surface or another semiconductor and gate electrode<sup>*</sup>  

<sup>*</sup>Charged surface of the semiconductor is implemented but not tested. 

### For developments of the SB program:
* implementing spin-dependent Schottky barrier
* testing charged semiconductors
